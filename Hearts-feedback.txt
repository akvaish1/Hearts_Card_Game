Student code or TS tests do not compile

If your code is compiling and running locally, see the following list of hints to troubleshoot why your submission does not compile on the automated system:
hint:  are you using the provided class constants from the project description?
hint:  are you using the provided method(s) from the project description?
hint:  are you spelling the methods correctly (including case)?
hint:  are you including the correct parameters and their types in those methods?
hint:  do your methods return the correct type?
hint:  do your unit tests only test the methods included in the project description? -- JUnit tests should only test the methods found in the project description (not main(), userInterface(), or other helper methods)
